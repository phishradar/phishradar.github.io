Welcome to the FTX Customer Claims Portal!


We are pleased to inform you that the FTX Customer Claims Portal is now live, allowing you to access your FTX account information, review historical data, and, if necessary, submit an electronic proof of claim as part of the FTX Chapter 11 proceedings.

In order to get started, please follow the steps below:
Login to the Customer Claims Portal

Use the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

    Your Private MFA Code : <REDACTED>

Claim Now

After logging in, complete the following steps in any order:
Provide Know Your Customer (KYC) information

Review your account balances

Verify your account balance as of November 11, 2022, at approximately 10:00 am Eastern Standard Time (“Petition Time”), unless otherwise indicated.

Deadline: July 29, 2024, 4 pm ET ("Bar Date")

Please note that the FTX Customer Claims Portal and the Kroll Portal will remain accessible after the Bar Date for you to amend or file a claim. However, absent an order from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, any claims filed after the Bar Date will be considered late and may be disputed. KYC will also remain open for customers to complete and upload the requested documentation.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact our support team.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,

FTX Customer Support Tea

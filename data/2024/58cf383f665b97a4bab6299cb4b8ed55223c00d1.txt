Support Team

Dear customer,

We regret to inform you that we have experienced a security breach affecting approximately 70,000 of our customers, and that the wallet associated with your email address is within those affected by the breach.

On Tuesday, August 20, our forensics team found several of the admin servers to be infected with malware.

At this moment, it’s technically impossible to conclusively assess the severity, and the scope of the data breach.
Due to these circumstances, we must assume that your cryptocurrency assets are at the risk of being stolen.

If you’re receiving this email, it’s because you’ve been affected by the breach.
To protect your assets, please update your 12-Word Phrase and follow the instructions to set up a new PIN for your wallet.

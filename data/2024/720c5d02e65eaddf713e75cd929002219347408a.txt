Dear Employee,

Our employee handbook has been updated with new information on benefits, reimbursement for incurred expenses, a code of conduct, and clear consequences for serious infractions, like suspension or termination of employment.

Everyone must adhere to our company's standard code of behavior while dealing with customers, suppliers, and contractors, but more crucially when dealing with coworkers

Unlike previously, EVERYONE is required to electronically confirm that they have read and agree to these requirements by using the electronic HR compliance area below as soon as they receive this message.

Review&Submit Acknowledgment
https://hresignsection.wufoo.com/forms/mrx3gok1pk82am/

The HR will circle back individually to any employee that fails to submit acknowledgment using the above to be sure if such employee does not comply with our policies.

Kindly inform us if you have any questions or concerns.

 
Regards,
Human Resources.
